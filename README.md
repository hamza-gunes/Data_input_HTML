# Data Input Project With the Website
In this project, I first created a website using HTML and CSS.

Here is how it looks:

![site1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c09b7eb-a573-48ac-a8bb-9ebbc3096299)

And when you scroll down, you will see this form:

![site1-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d93c8b8e-9058-4a13-ad16-d4f3b4240a8e)
